We would love to stay in August, but we are worried about security. 

Last week, our friend told us your FACEBOOK group got hacked by an Islamic group and they put something on there in Islamic/Arabic writing. I hope you can appreciate our concerns. 

Was this a direct threat to the Padma or its visitors?

Can the Padma guarantee the safety of guests?

Is your resort safe to stay at?

Were police notified?

We don't want to come if security and safety is an issue. Please help us know if everything is safe.

In other words we did not have to pack up from the pool to hit happy hour to get the full monies worth of our upgrade costs.

ニューデラックスシャレーは、隣り同士のお部屋を入口のドアで、同じ鍵で行き来できるようにしているお部屋をコネクティングルームと呼んでおり、1階にのみ存在いたします。

お部屋内部に内扉は無いですが、2つの入口ドアの前を、更なるスライディングドアで仕切ってつなげることが可能です。

また、バスタブが無くて、その分収納スペースを広くしたお部屋が数部屋存在します。「バスタブ希望」とご予約時に仰っていただくとより確実かもしれません（基本的には日本人のお客様には、私共の方でバスタブ付きのお部屋を手配させていただく事が多いです）

ガーデンクラブシャレーと、プレミアクラブシャレーの違いは何でしょうか？

両方ともクラブ特典が付いていますか？

ホテル内の立地は異なりますか？",Answer from PadmaResort_GRO,"お問合せありがとうございます。

プレミアクラブシャレーは、よりカップルのお客様に人気が高いお部屋です。ベッドタイプは全てダブル（キングマット）、ダブルシンク（バスルームに洗面台が2つ）の仕様となっております。
内装家具のデザインは、ガーデンクラブシャレーと大変近いものを使用しておりますが、お部屋のサイズも若干大きいです。また、ガーデンクラブシャレーはデラックスシャレーのお部屋にクラブ特典が付いたお部屋でございます。なので、デラックスシャレー（クラブ特典なし）とガーデンクラブシャレー（クラブ特典あり）のお部屋は、全くは同じでございます。

パドマリゾートのキッズクラブは毎日1時間毎に異なったアクティビティーを行っておりますので、お子様で大変賑わっております。日本語を喋れるスタッフはおりませんが、日本人のお子様も何故か違う国のお子様達と楽しく遊んでいらっしゃる姿をよく見ますので、保育園等で人馴れしているお子様であればまず問題はないようです。

もし人見知りさんで、お子様が泣き止まない場合も、事前に仰っていただければスタッフが親にお電話させていただく事が可能です。

尚キッズクラブのご利用は、４歳以下のお子様はご両親かベビーシッター同伴でご利用いただいております。ベビーシッターは、2017年5月の価格で１時間65000ルピア（約600円）です。ベビーシッターも日本語はしゃべれませんが、多くの日本人のお客様に良い評価をいただいております。

下記の点について教えていただけたらと思います。

⒈過去の質問でラグーンアクセスルームの湿気について、スタッフの方のコメントがありました。
    湿気がひどいのでしょうか？
2.大人2人と子ども2人(6歳と4歳)と宿泊予定です。
    4歳が添い寝でしたら可能でしょうか？
3. 可能な場合、6歳の子どもの分はエキストラベッドが入るのでしょうか？
4.ラグーンアクセスルームはキッズエリアやクラブラウンジから離れているのでしょうか？
5.チェックイン後の利用する、クラブラウンジやデパーチャーラウンジはデイベッドのような場所はありますか？
 また、ブランケットのようなものはお借りできますか？
6.2泊以上の特典の空港送迎は、出発のどれくらい前にピックアップとなりますか？
    ガルーダの0:55発の予定です。

質問が多くなりましたが、よろしく回答願います。",Answer from PadmaResort_GRO,しばらくTripAdvisorの日本語アクセスをお休みしており、申し訳ございませんでした。既に不要の回答とは存じますが、同様のご質問をお持ちの方もいらっしゃると思いますので、回答させていただきます。 1.バリ島の雨季(10月～3月頃)は、もともと湿気が高い季節ですので、プールアクセスのお部屋の湿気は多少気になるかもしれません。ですがお部屋によるものではなく、バリ島全体の気候よるものです。リクエストにより、除湿器をお貸出しする事も可能です。 2.ラグーンアクセスのルームの１室最大利用人数は3名様まで、お子様(幼児)を含む4名様でのご予約は通常受け付けておりません。 3.お子様のエキストラベッドの有無はご選択が可能ですが、当ホテルでは、エキストラベッド代ではなく、ご朝食を含むご宿泊代として料金設定をしておりますので、エキストラベッド有無の料金は、同額でございます。 4.徒歩2～3分でございます。 5.申し訳ございません。デイベッドのご用意はございませんが、コーヒー紅茶、椅子とテーブル、シャワー、サウナ等はご利用いただけます。シャワー用のタオルも無料貸出ししております。 6.空港送迎はご利用の3日前までにご予約下さい。ホテルから空港までのご出発時間は、道の渋滞具合にもよりますが、通常はフライトご出発時間の2時間半から3時間前に設定させていただく事が多いです。渋滞具合により早めのご案内をさせていただく事もございます。,17-May,"shibarakutripadvisornoRi  Yu akusesuwooXiu mishiteori, Shen shiYi gozaimasendeshita.

ファミリールームは大人2名お子様2名の価格設定になっておりますので追加料金はかかりませんが、その他のお部屋タイプは1部屋で大人2名様の価格設定になっております。

みふ様がパドマの公式オンラインでご予約の場合、大人2名様、子供1名様、幼児を０名様にしてお部屋を検索ください。１部屋に入るエキストラベッドは1点になりますので、5歳のお子様がご両親とのベッドシェアになります。

またはファミリーデラックスシャレーのように、2部屋分を繋げてご利用ください。（その場合は大人2名様、子供1名様、幼児を１名様にしてお部屋を検索ください。)

サイト上で記載されました価格が、税込みで、お子様の追加料金を込んだ価格となります。

①デパーチャーラウンジが満席で使用できない状況は、今まで見たことがございませんので、おそらく大丈夫かと存じます。スーツケースを持ち運ぶのは大変ですので、チェックアウト後はスーツケースをロビーにお預けいただき、着替え等の軽いお荷物のみでディパーチャーラウンジやホテル施設内をご利用ください。チェックアウト後のプールのご利用も可能ですので、ご出発直前までホテルをご満喫ください。

②マネキュア、ペティキュア、シルクスリッパ、スムーズダウン、エルミスプロダクトを利用したトリートメントには、割引きが適応されません。到着してからのご予約でも、翌日以降のご予約であればある程度は空きがございますが、”より確実に”ということであれば事前予約をお薦めいたします。

③水曜日はバリニーズ料理の食べ放題です。19:30頃からバリダンスもご鑑賞いただけます。火曜日と木曜日は、在住者にも人気の日本食の食べ放題(鉄板焼き、寿司、天ぷら、その他シェフお薦めの一品料理多数、トロピカルフルーツ等)がお楽しみいただけます。大変混み合いますので、前日までにご予約くださいませ。テーマディナーは、天候やイベント行事により、予告無くテーマが突然変更になる場合がございます、チェックインの際に再確認をお願いいたします。

ウチダ様にお会いできるのを楽しみにしております。

幾つか質問がございます。

①宿泊の際にそちらのスパを利用したいと思っているのですが、宿泊客には割引があると聞いております。
直接スパのメールに予約をしても可能、及び割引がきく
ものでしょうか？

②以前、こちらのほてるに宿泊された方のブログに「無料のランドリーを利用できて助かった」と書かれていたように思うのですが、そういったサービスはご用意されているのでしょうか？。たまたまこの方にサービスがあっただけなのでしょうか。

③バリ王を通して予約させていただいたのですが、時期的にガーデンシャレーへの予約ができませんでした。
宿泊時もしくは現段階で空きがあれば、差額をお支払すればグレードアップは可能でしょうか？
予約を取りました旅行会社は休日のため連絡が取れません。

直接、ホテルの問い合わ先にご相談させていただきたかったのですが、問い合わせ先メールアドレスを見つけられず、こちらから質問させていただきました。

出発までに日がなく、お忙しいところ大変申し訳ありませんがなにとぞ、お早いご回答のほどよろしくお願いいたします。",Answer from PadmaResort_GRO,"お問合せありがとうございます。
番号順に回答させていただきます。

①各ご宿泊者のパッケージに割引券が付いていたり、スパが独自に出している期間限定のキャンペーンがあったりするので、現場で見比べてお得な特典をご利用ください。直接メールで事前予約をされても、割引き対象のトリートメントであればご精算時に割引きが適応されます。

②一部の旅行会社様から、クラブラウンジがご利用できるお部屋タイプをご予約いただいた場合に、フリーランドリーの特典が付いております。全てのお客様についている特典ではございません。

③チェックイン時でも、お部屋に空きがあれば有料でアップグレードをする事が可能です。ご予約を旅行会社を通して行われている場合、差額の料金設定もお支払い条件も、その旅行会社によるものとなります。ホテル側から旅行会社に連絡させていただき、お支払条件等をお客様にご了承いただきました後、お部屋の変更が確定します。

お部屋タイプのご希望に関しましては、お部屋の空き状況により100％のお約束が出来ません事を先にご了承いただいておりますが、お部屋をご用意する際には必ず確認し、できる限りご希望に合ったお部屋を押さえております。万一、お部屋が取れなかった場合、翌日空きがあればご移動いただいたり、少しチェックインをお待ちいただく事によりお部屋のご用意が出来たりもしますので、そういった代案もご用意いたします。個人でご確認いただいても、同じ回答になります。

シャレーは2階建て、ホテル棟は4階建てですが、どちらをご予約いただいても、階数の希望をお受けできる率は同じです。例えば、どうしてもシャレーの2階に空きが出ない場合、「ビルディングタイプなら2階以上のお部屋がございます」と言ったご提案もさせていただきます。ビル棟の前がラグーンプールなので、湿気を特に気にされるようでしたら、シャレーをお薦めいたします。

レイトチェックアウトに関しては、各旅行会社によって料金設定がことなりますので、お申し込みされた旅行会社に一度ご確認ください。ホテルで直接お申し込みをされたい場合は、当日のホテルインターネット宿泊料金(キャンペーン料金ではない通常料金)の半額で18時まで、それ以降は1泊料金にて承ります。

お荷物のお預かりもしておりますし、シャワーやロッカー付きのご出発ラウンジもございますので、よろしければそちらも最終日の選択肢の一つに加えてください。

If you want clean beaches go to Kuta (surfing) or Nusa Dua (just swimming in the sea).

But Alila and W resorts have great views of the ocean, the breakfast view and the spread is also very inspiring at Alila and W resorts. Not so for the Seminyak beach resort. Breakfast spread is minimal and without a view of the ocean.

Dear Valued Guest 
Greetings from The Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa, Bali 

Due to exceptionally strong tidal waves, our sea-facing retaining wall, stairs to the beach, temple, pavilion and adjacent areas have been severely damaged, and we have been advised to undertake essential repair works. As the safety, security and enjoyment of our guests is of the utmost importance to us and the Resort’s reputation, we will need to temporarily close the Main Resort, including its facilities and beach access, keeping only the Garden Wing open. We apologize for any inconvenience this might cause and sincerely thank you for your patience and ongoing support.

Although  we are unable to accept reservations at the Main Resort  from 1st November until 1st March 2018, the Garden Rooms at The Garden Wing are still available for booking as usual .This building is  located across the street from the main Beachfront Resort, offering relaxation within a self-contained compound of just 29 spacious 47sqm (506 sq ft) rooms, complete with its own 24-hour Reception, Hospitality Lounge and Business Centre, Spa Room, Swimming Pool and Bar. The interiors of the Garden Rooms are identical to the Beach Rooms, but it’s important to note that during the period of closure, all of the main resort facilities – including the infinity pool, beach access, and the restaurants – will be closed, we are therefore offering a Generous Promotional Rate for stays in our Garden Rooms from 1st November 2017 – 28th February 2018.",17-Oct, valued guest greetings  beach  spa  due exceptionally strong tidal waves sea facing retaining wall stairs beach temple pavilion adjacent areas severely damaged advised undertake essential repair works safety security enjoyment guests utmost importance   reputation need temporarily close   including facilities beach access keeping garden wing open apologize inconvenience might cause sincerely  patience ongoing support although unable accept reservations   1st november 1st march garden rooms garden wing still available booking usual building located across street  beachfront  offering relaxation within self contained compound spacious 47sqm sq ft rooms complete hour reception hospitality lounge business centre spa  swimming pool bar interiors garden rooms identical beach rooms  important note period closure   facilities - including infinity pool beach access restaurants - closed therefore offering generous promotional rate stays garden rooms 1st november - 28th february,mention renovation however first says start end year says start next year  confirm  place due complete

I am hoping to come Christmas time this year with my husband and our two friends for 10 nights.

We have never been to Bali before and I really want to make sure this is a memorable stay as it's been many years since we've had a holiday like this.

As Christmas time is a very expensive time to come I would love to have a room with an ocean view but I don't think I can afford it. 

What are the best rooms to have an ocean view or be near it etc

Any other feed back would be really appreciated like, how close are the shops to this resort, other restaurants, are there markets etc etc.

Kind regards

I know the distance between Padma Resort Ubud and Airport isn't as long as from Padma Ubud to Saranam Hotel in Bedugul.

the Padma Resort Ubud to 2 other couples and friends of mine so that they also will stay in your hotel for the first time this year.
